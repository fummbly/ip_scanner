# IP Scanner

This is a program for scanning ips on a network. It is created with python as a way for me to understand network communication and program development. 

## Usage

To use this program you must clone the git repo and then type ```python main.py x.x.x.x/x``` where "x.x.x.x" is the starting IP eg. "10.0.0.0" and "/x" is the CIDR range you want to scan eg. "/24" which is a .255 mask [CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing)
## Installation 

To install the program just make a directory you would like to install it in and then clone it with ```git clone https://www.github.com/fummbly/ip_scanner```
